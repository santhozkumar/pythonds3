Collections such as stacks, queues, deques and list are often referred to as linear data structures.  
items in above collections are ordered depending on how they are added or removed  
Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it  


## Stack
- stack of books/trays
- Web browser back button(as we navigate from page to page, those pages are placed on a stack)
### The stack Abstract Data type
- **Stack()** creates a new stack that is empty
- **push(item)** adds a new item at the top of the stack
- **pop()** removes the top item
- **peek()** returns the top item, but not modifies the stack
- **is_empty()** returns true if the stack is empty
- **size()** returns the number of items on the stack
